            <h3>Dinosaurs</h3>
            <!-- <p style="color: red;">VOLUME WARNING! This track starts loud.</p> -->
            <p>This is one of most newest tracks, and my first to include my own vocals.</p>
            <p>My main goal with this song was to write something heavy, and cool, even though the lyrics are a bit tongue in cheek. 
                Imagery played a key role in developing this track, in both the lyrics and the underlying music. My hope is that 
                the intro depicts dinosaur roars, the lyrics set the stage, and the solo says the rest.
            </p>

            <h3>Cosmic Paradox</h3>
            <p>I wrote this track thinking about our existence in space, and how distant everything is. This song is a yearning for something beyond our place in space..</p>
            <p><em><u>This should be more music theory concepts used, less explaining parts.</u></em>One of my more evocative tracks, this track begins very lonesome and nostalgic, crescendoing into a beautiful middle section, 
                before devolving into chaos and confusion, followed by a flowing jam, and ending with a return to our nostalgic origins. This track focused on transitions, development, and deliberate production choices.
